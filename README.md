**Abstract**

The selection and validation of probabilistic models for reliability data, often characterized by positive support ($\mathbb{R}_+$) and asymmetric shapes, are crucial for practical applications in industrial processes and decision-making. This work explores Mellin statistics (log-cumulants $\kappa_2$ and $\kappa_3$) to develop a log-cumulant diagram $(\kappa_3, \kappa_2)$ and propose a goodness-of-fit test based on an adaptation of Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic. This approach offers a straightforward tool to classify and assess probabilistic models aimed at positive data, using key reliability distributions (Weibull, Fréchet, Gamma, and Inverse-Gamma) to define separation regions. The methodology was tested on nine real reliability datasets. Results indicate that the adapted $T^2$ test is consistent with traditional methods (AD, CvM) and the AIC criterion, exhibiting good performance even for sample sizes typical in the field. The applications demonstrate that the test provides additional discriminatory power by capturing distributional shape characteristics on the logarithmic scale, positioning it as a practical and robust tool for reliability data analysis.
